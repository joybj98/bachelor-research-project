# bachelor-research-project

***

These programs are created for **personal purpose** (bachelor research project). 

Also, there is **neither co-writer nor co-worker** that would read or use these programs. The supervisor of the theis does not read or check the codes as well.

Due to the time limit of this bachelor research project, **the readablitiy and generalization ability of the programs is poor.**

### Introduction

interpolation.py:

to do IDW interpolation. The old version for new_interp.py. This one is not recommended.

#### new interp.py:

To do spatial IDW interpolation for climate models. Much faster than interpolation.py even without multiprocessing. **Recommended**

#### weighting.py

Assigning weights and do statistical evaluation for weighted average data raw datah. **Recommended**

#### output_bathy.py & output_wind.py

Generate the bathymetry data and wind data input file for SWAN.

#### concact_JRA.py

Concacting JRA-55 data into one file. Though this process may be meaningless.

#### compute_mean_of_variants.py

Compute the mean of multiple variants (ensembles) for one type of climate model
